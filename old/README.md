Welcome to the Learning Challenges Repository! 
This repository is a collection of code snippets, exercises, and mini-projects that I am working on
as part of a challenge with friends to improve our coding skills. This is not an actual project, but
rather a playground to experiment with new concepts, techniques, and tools.
<h3>Happy coding and happy learning!</h3>
